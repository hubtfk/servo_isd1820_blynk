In this project, we are working with the following components:

    NodeMCU (ESP8266)
    Servo Motor
    ISD1820 Module
    Power Supply for Servo Motor
    Blynk
    Power Supply for NodeMCU and ISD1820


Here is a high-level description of how your circuit should be wired:

    NodeMCU (ESP8266):
    Connect the NodeMCU to a power source (typically 5V USB or an external power supply) and make sure it is properly powered.
    Servo Motor:
    Connect the signal wire of the servo (typically orange or yellow) to a PWM-capable pin on the NodeMCU (e.g., D4).
    Connect the servo's power wire (typically red) to a 5V power source.
    Connect the servo's ground wire (typically brown) to a ground (GND) pin on the NodeMCU.
    Ensure that the servo's power source is capable of providing enough current for the servo motor.

ISD1820 Module:

    Connect the REC (Record) pin of the ISD1820 module to a digital pin on the NodeMCU (e.g., D2).
    Connect the PLAYE (Playback Enable) pin of the ISD1820 module to a digital pin on the NodeMCU (e.g., D3).
    Connect the VCC (Voltage) pin of the ISD1820 module to a 5V power source.
    Connect the GND (Ground) pin of the ISD1820 module to a ground (GND) pin on the NodeMCU.

Blynk:

    Ensure that your NodeMCU is connected to the internet and can communicate with the Blynk server. You should configure your Blynk project and obtain an authentication token, which you've already defined in your code.
    Power Supply:
    Make sure the power supply for the servo motor and the ISD1820 module can provide the required voltage and current for their operation.
